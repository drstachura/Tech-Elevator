-- Frank suggests making the entire exercise one transaction
-- because several exercises depend on previous execises running
-- if you try to make smaller transaction, Frank says you will drive yourself nuts
-- put a Begin Transacation; at the start and a rollback; at then until you are sure
-- everything works ok if you want
--
-- ignore #12 until tomorrow.... if you can't look at the end of today's lecture
--
-- consider running verify selects before and/or after your inserts, update, deletes
-- you changes will NOT be in the tables if you doing a rollback
--
-- Be sure you know what the data types and contents of columns
-- Consider that some columns are generated by the database on insert - you don't need to specify them
--                    and you don't want to specify them, but you may need to know what they are

-- Remember the movie "Hunt for Red October"?  What were they always doing?  a sub query!
